## Traffic Volumes Modelling Project

### Purpose
Develop a methodology for estimating traffic volumes on road segments in the City of Toronto.

### Introduction

- Availabiliy of volume data in City
- Need for volume profiles

The City of Toronto's traffic volume collection efforts can be broken into three (3) buckets:

**1. Permanent Traffic Counts:** Loop detectors, most of which are under the jurisdiction of the RESCU traffic management system and primarily cover the Gardiner Expressway, Don Valley Parkway, Lakeshore Boulevard and Allen Road.

**2. Short Period Traffic Counts (SPTCs):** Volumes collected using temporary automatic traffic recorders (ATRs), and typically carried out over 3 or 7-day periods. These are typically gathered through a City-run rotating count program or as a result of traffic impact studies.

**3. Turning Movement Counts (TMCs):** Volumes can be inferred using manual turning movement counts, although these typically do not cover a full 24-hour period and may have significant gaps given the manual nature of these counts.
